# CRITICAL FIX FOR SESSION ISSUES
# 
# In your server's .env file, CHANGE this line:
# SESSION_DOMAIN=admin.tfcmockup.com
#
# TO this (remove the domain):
# SESSION_DOMAIN=
#
# OR completely delete the SESSION_DOMAIN line
#
# This allows the session cookie to work with the exact domain
# instead of causing cookie domain conflicts

echo "Update your server .env file:";
echo "Remove or empty SESSION_DOMAIN=admin.tfcmockup.com";
echo "Change to: SESSION_DOMAIN=";
